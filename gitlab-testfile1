I have created new repo named as - gitlab
copy the url 
got to my ec2 instance terminal
clone the new,lty created repo with below command
git clone https://url
Initiate the git aftre cloning the repo from github first go insidfele to cloneed directorey with cd command
git init
create one file fr testing purpose is the git push working or not
cat fiel name
add siome contents in to it 
git add .
agit commit -m "testcommit"
git push origin main
username: abc
password : the same token which is previously created by us to access the git repo for push 
the token create by us is not only valid for single repo push . Token is valid for entire account to push and pull the contents from and to the account vise-versa. 
Token is valid for eniter account containing repo's. Is not limited for any single repo. Token represents push and pull from your local workspace to any repository created on github.

But there is an catch. 
fif you go with any diffrent repo to push the contaents from your locakl work space . First you may clone the repo to your local work space  and lioginto the same repo folder with hethe help of cd command and then int git in side the repo to push and pull the conmtents.

All abiove said is the Real sennario based KT to Ullas banamagi . 

I hope his freezed mind can get this info into the present mind state. 

Rest - Good Luck............!
